    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "The data provided is a randomly collected sample of size $n = 4870$, with a sample proportion of success of getting a call among blacks is $\\hat{p_{b}} = 6.45$% and among whites is $\\hat{p_{w}} = 9.65$%. Given this data, the goal is to draw inferences on the differences of proportions among general population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sample proportions are well characterized by a nearly normal distribution when certain conditions are satisﬁed, making it possible to employ the usual conﬁdence interval and hypothesis testing tools. It follows that if both sampling distributions for  sample proportions are normal, then the sampling distribution of their difference is also normal.\n",

    "We can use Central Limit Theorem for Hypothesis testing if the following conditions are met for each sample proportion:\n",
    "1. Randomness: Data comes from a simple random sample.\n",
    "2. Independence: Each observation will not influence another as the resumes are nearly identical. The sample is less than 10% of population.\n",
    "3. Success-Failure Condition: At least 10 success and 10 failures are seen in the sample, which is true, as there are $157$ successes and $2278$ failures for blacks and $235$ successes and $2200$ failures for whites respectively.\n",
    "4. Independence between groups: Since a person can either be black or white and not both, we can assume independence among groups.\n",
